# Channel3d
&emsp;**Channel3d** is an efficient second- /fourth-order finite-difference direct numerical simulation (DNS) solver with versatile viscous treatments, also with the ability to handle different boundary conditions:

* Versatile viscous treatmens. The viscous term can be handled full implicitly, full explicitly, or partial implicitly
* Have the ability to handle periodic, no-slip and free-slip boundary conditions
* Second-order spatial accuray in non-periodic directions, fourth-order scheme is also available for periodic directions 
* FFT-based ([FFTW](https://github.com/FFTW/fftw3) used here) method is used for Pressure Poisson Equation (PPE)
* Alternating direction implicit (ADI) is adopted for Helmholtz equations
* MPI parallelization by means of pencil distributed decomposition, using [2DECOMP&FFT](http://www.2decomp.org/)

## Installation :briefcase:
&emsp;During developing this solver, I often try my best to make it easy-to-understand and easy-to-use. As for compilation, present solver only has the following two prerequisites:

* MPI
* Gfortran/Intel Fortran (Supporting Fortran 2003 or higher version)

&emsp;**FFTW-3.3.8** library has been explicitly included in the direction `./src/ThirdParty/fftw/`, so compiling and additional linking to external FFTW are avoided. After entering the folder `Channe3d-master` in terminal, you can compile the code as follows:
```
1. chmod a+x ./mymake.sh
2. ./mymake.sh
3. choose the correct compiler you use, and the executable you want to compile, following guidances printed in the terminal
```
## Usage :book:
&emsp;

## To do list :muscle:

* Fourth-order scheme options for non-periodic directions
* Adding a passive scalar transport solver
* Hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization and GPU acceleration  
* **Channel3d** presented here is a part of my integral project: **CP3d**, Channnel-Particle 3d, which is still under development, and will be open source in the coming future. My ultimate aim for **CP3d** project is to develop an efficient and easy-to-use  particle-laden flow solver, including one-way, two-way, and full four-way coupling methods, by combination with Basset history force model, discrete element method (DEM), and immersed boundary method (IBM).

&emsp;Without those researchers' help, I might do nothing but sleep in the dormitory all the days!!!:joy::joy::joy:   
&emsp;Thanks so much again and again !!!
