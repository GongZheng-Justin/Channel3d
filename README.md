# Channel3d
second- /fourth-order finite-difference direct numerical simulation (DNS) solver with versatile viscous treatments

## Installation
&emsp;During developing this solver, I often try my best to make it easy-to-use. As for compilation, the present solver only has the following two prerequisites:

* MPI
* Gfortran/Intel Fortran (Surporting Fortran2003 or higher version)

&emsp;The steps way to configure and build AFiD are as follows:

## Acknowledgements
&emsp;Since Sep 2019, when I finally decided to develop my own CFD-DEM code from scratch, I have learnt quite a lot from the following really kind researchers (**in alphabetical sequence**):

* [Dr. Costa](https://p-costa.github.io/) from University of Iceland, and his second-order DNS code [CaNS](https://github.com/p-costa/CaNS), also his papers on IBM approach.
* [Dr. He](https://www.engineering.iastate.edu/people/profile/phe/) from Iowa State University, and his fourth-order DNS solver [HercuLES](https://github.com/friedenhe/hercules).
* [Prof. Ji](http://faculty.tju.edu.cn/ChunningJi/en/index.htm) from Tianji University, on the fruitful discussion about the particle IBM method, and on the accsee to their in-house DNS/LES-Solid interaction code **_cgLES_**.
* [Dr. Laizet](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.laizet) from Imperial College London, and their compact FD code [Incompact3d](https://github.com/xcompact3d/Incompact3d).
* [Prof. Marchioli](http://158.110.32.35/) from University of Udine, on the fruitful and continuous discussion about one-way CFD-Particle coupling benchmark and on the access to their [benckmark data](http://158.110.32.35/download/DNS-TEST-CASE/).
* [Dr. Norouzi](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hamid-Norourzi) from University of Tehran, and his book **_Coupled CFD‐DEM Modeling: Formulation, Implementation and Applimation to Multiphase Flows_**, besides the [attached DEM code](https://www.wiley.com//legacy/wileychi/norouzi/form.html?type=SupplementaryMaterial).
* [Prof. Orlandi](http://dma.ing.uniroma1.it/users/orlandi/resume.html) from Sapienza University of Rome, and his book **_Fluid flow phenomena: a numerical toolkit_**, besides the [attached CFD code](http://dma.ing.uniroma1.it/users/orlandi/diskette.tar.gz).
* [Dr. Tschisgale](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Silvio-Tschisgale) from Institute of Air Handling and Refrigeration, on the fruitful and continuous discussion about their IBM approach.
* [Prof. Zhao](http://www.hy.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1154/1829.htm) from Tsinghua university, on the one-way CFD-Particle coupling benchmark.

&emsp;Without those researchers' help, I might do nothing but sleep in the dormitory all the days !!!  
&emsp;Thanks so much again and agian !!!
